License: GFDL-1.2
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
 assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
 with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
 for modifications made by others.
 . 
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
